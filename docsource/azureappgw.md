# Overview

The Azure Application Gateway Certificate store type, `AzureAppGw`, manages `ApplicationGatewaySslCertificate` objects owned by Azure Application Gateways. This store type collects inventory and manages all ApplicationGatewaySslCertificate objects associated with an Application Gateway. The store type is implemented primarily for Inventory and Management Remove operations, since the intended usage of ApplicationGatewaySslCertificates in Application Gateways is for serving TLS client traffic via TLS Listeners. Management Add and associated logic for certificate renewal is also supported for this certificate store type for completeness, but the primary intended functionality of this extension is implemented with the App Gateway Certificate Binding store type.

> If an ApplicationGatewaySslCertificate is bound to a TLS Listener at the time of a Management Remove operation, the operation will fail since at least one certificate must be bound at all times.

> If a renewal job is scheduled for an `AzureAppGw` certificate store, the extension will report a success and perform no action if the certificate being renewed is bound to a TLS Listener. This is because a certificate located in an `AzureAppGw` certificate store that is bound to a TLS Listener is logically the same as the same certificate located in an `AzureAppGwBin` store type. For this reason, it's expected that the certificate will be renewed and re-bound to the listener by the `AppGwBin` certificate operations.
>
> If the renewed certificate is not bound to a TLS Listener, the operation will be performed the same as any certificate renewal process that honors the Overwrite flag.

# Requirements

### Azure Service Principal (Azure Resource Manager Authentication)

The Azure Application Gateway Orchestrator extension uses an [Azure Service Principal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/app-objects-and-service-principals?tabs=browser) for authentication. Follow [Microsoft's documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/howto-create-service-principal-portal) to create a service principal.

#### Azure Application Gateway permissions

For quick start and non-production environments, a Role Assignment should be created on _each resource group_ that own Application Gateways desiring management that grants the created Application/Service Principal the [Contributor (Privileged administrator) Role](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#contributor). For production environments, a custom role should be created that grants the following permissions:

- `Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resourcegroups/read` - Read : Get Resource Group
- `Microsoft.Network/applicationGateways/read` - Read : Get Application Gateway
- `Microsoft.Network/applicationGateways/write` - Write : Create or Update Application Gateway
- `Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/assign/action` - Other : RBAC action for assigning an existing user assigned identity to a resource
- `Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/join/action` - Other : Joins a virtual network. Not Alertable.

> Note that even if the Service Principal has permission to perform the 'Microsoft.Network/applicationGateways/write' action over the scope of the required resource group, there may be other permissions that are required by the CreateOrUpdate operation depending on the complexity of the Application Gateway's configuration. As such, the list of permissions above should not be considered as comprehensive.

#### Azure Key Vault permissions

If the managed Application Gateway is integrated with Azure Key Vault per the discussion in the [Certificates Imported to Application Gateways from Azure Key Vault](#certificates-imported-to-application-gateways-from-azure-key-vault) section, perform one of the following actions for each Key Vault with certificates imported to App Gateways:
* **Azure role-based access control** - Create a Role Assignment that grants the Application/Service Principal the [Key Vault Secrets User](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/rbac-guide?tabs=azure-cli) built-in role.
* **Vault access policy** - [Create an Access Policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/assign-access-policy?tabs=azure-portal) that grants the Application/Service Principal the Get secret permission for each Azure Key Vault.

#### Client Certificate or Client Secret

Beginning in version 3.0.0, the Azure Application Gateway Orchestrator extension supports both [client certificate authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-register-app-v2#option-1-add-a-certificate) and [client secret](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-register-app-v2#option-2-add-a-client-secret) authentication.

* **Client Secret** - Follow [Microsoft's documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-register-app-v2#option-2-add-a-client-secret) to create a Client Secret. This secret will be used as the **Server Password** field in the [Certificate Store Configuration](#certificate-store-configuration) section.
* **Client Certificate** - Create a client certificate key pair with the Client Authentication extended key usage. The client certificate will be used in the ClientCertificate field in the [Certificate Store Configuration](#certificate-store-configuration) section. If you have access to Keyfactor Command, the instructions in this section walk you through enrolling a certificate and ensuring that it's in the correct format. Once enrolled, follow [Microsoft's documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-register-app-v2#option-1-add-a-certificate) to add the _public key_ certificate (no private key) to the service principal used for authentication.

    The certificate can be in either of the following formats:
    * Base64-encoded PKCS#12 (PFX) with a matching private key.
    * Base64-encoded PEM-encoded certificate _and_ PEM-encoded PKCS8 private key. Make sure that the certificate and private key are separated with a newline. The order doesn't matter - the extension will determine which is which.

    If the private key is encrypted, the encryption password will replace the **Server Password** field in the [Certificate Store Configuration](#certificate-store-configuration) section.

> **Creating and Formatting a Client Certificate using Keyfactor Command**
>
> To get started quickly, you can follow the instructions below to create and properly format a client certificate to authenticate to the Microsoft Graph API.
>
> 1. In Keyfactor Command, hover over **Enrollment** and select **PFX Enrollment**.
> 2. Select a **Template** that supports Client Authentication as an extended key usage.
> 3. Populate the certificate subject as appropriate for the Template. It may be sufficient to only populate the Common Name, but consult your IT policy to ensure that this certificate is compliant.
> 4. At the bottom of the page, uncheck the box for **Include Chain**, and select either **PFX** or **PEM** as the certificate Format.
> 5. Make a note of the password on the next page - it won't be shown again.
> 6. Prepare the certificate and private key for Azure and the Orchestrator extension:
>     * If you downloaded the certificate in PEM format, use the commands below:
>
>        ```shell
>        # Verify that the certificate downloaded from Command contains the certificate and private key. They should be in the same file
>        cat <your_certificate.pem>
>
>        # Separate the certificate from the private key
>        openssl x509 -in <your_certificate.pem> -out pubkeycert.pem
>
>        # Base64 encode the certificate and private key
>        cat <your_certificate.pem> | base64 > clientcertkeypair.pem.base64
>        ```
>
>    * If you downloaded the certificate in PFX format, use the commands below:
>
>        ```shell
>        # Export the certificate from the PFX file
>        openssl pkcs12 -in <your_certificate.pfx> -clcerts -nokeys -out pubkeycert.pem
>
>        # Base64 encode the PFX file
>        cat <your_certificate.pfx> | base64 > clientcert.pfx.base64
>        ```
> 7. Follow [Microsoft's documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-register-app-v2#option-1-add-a-certificate) to add the public key certificate to the service principal used for authentication.
>
> You will use `clientcert.[pem|pfx].base64` as the **ClientCertificate** field in the [Certificate Store Configuration](#certificate-store-configuration) section. 

# Extension Mechanics

### Discovery Job

The Discovery operation discovers all Azure Application Gateways in each resource group that the service principal has access to. The discovered Application Gateways are reported back to Command and can be easily added as certificate stores from the Locations tab.

The Discovery operation uses the "Directories to search" field, and accepts input in one of the following formats:
- `*` - If the asterisk symbol `*` is used, the extension will search for Application Gateways in every resource group that the service principal has access to, but only in the tenant that the discovery job was configured for as specified by the "Client Machine" field in the certificate store configuration.
- `<tenant-id>,<tenant-id>,...` - If a comma-separated list of tenant IDs is used, the extension will search for Application Gateways in every resource group and tenant specified in the list. The tenant IDs should be the GUIDs associated with each tenant, and it's the user's responsibility to ensure that the service principal has access to the specified tenants.

> The Discovery Job only supports Client Secret authentication.

### Certificates Imported to Application Gateways from Azure Key Vault

Natively, Azure Application Gateways support integration with Azure Key Vault for secret/certificate management. This integration works by creating a TLS Listener certificate with a reference to a secret in Azure Key Vault (specifically, a URI in the format `https://<vault-name>.vault.azure.net/secrets/<secret-name>`), authenticated using a Managed Identity. If the Application Gateway orchestrator extension is deployed to manage App Gateways with certificates imported from Azure Key Vault, the following truth table represents the possible operations and their result, specifically with respect to AKV.

| Store Type   | Operation | Result                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|--------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `AzureAppGw` | Inventory | Certificate is downloaded from Azure Key Vault and reported back to Keyfactor Command. In Keyfactor Command, the certificate will show as being located in the AzureAppGw certificate store [in addition to the AKV, if AKV orchestrator extension is also deployed].                                                                                                                         |
| `AzureAppGw` | Add       | The Add operation will not create secrets in AKV; it creates ApplicationGatewaySslCertificates.<br/> <br/>If an `AzureAppGw` Add operation is scheduled with the Replace flag, the _**link to the AKV certificate will be broken**_, and a native ApplicationGatewaySslCertificate will be created in its place - The secret in AKV will still exist.                                       |
| `AzureAppGw` | Remove    | The ApplicationGatewaySslCertificate is deleted from the Application Gateway, but the secret that the certificate referenced in AKV still exists.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `AzureAppGwBin`   | Inventory | Certificate is downloaded from Azure Key Vault and reported back to Keyfactor Command. In Keyfactor Command, the certificate will show as present in both an `AzureAppGw` certificate store _and_ an `AppGwBin` certificate store [in addition to the AKV, if AKV orchestrator extension is also deployed].                                                                                   |
| `AzureAppGwBin`   | Add       | The Add operation will not create secrets in AKV; it creates ApplicationGatewaySslCertificates. <br/> <br/>If a certificate with the same name as the TLS Listener already exists, it will be _replaced_ by a new ApplicationGatewaySslCertificate. <br/> <br/>If the certificate being replaced was imported from AKV, this binding will be broken and the secret will still exist in AKV. |

#### Mechanics of the Azure Key Vault Download Operation for Inventory Jobs that report certificates imported from AKV

If an AzureApplicationSslCertificate references a secret in AKV (was imported to the App Gateway from AKV), the inventory job will create and use a `SecretClient` from the [`Azure.Security.KeyVault.Secrets.SecretClient` dotnet package](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/azure.security.keyvault.secrets.secretclient?view=azure-dotnet). Authentication to AKV via this client is configured using the exact same `TokenCredential` provided by the [Azure Identity client library for .NET](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/overview/azure/identity-readme?view=azure-dotnet). This means that the Service Principal described in the [Azure Configuration](#azure-configuration) section must also have appropriate permissions to read secrets from the AKV that the App Gateway is integrated with. The secret referenced in the AzureApplicationSslCertificate will be accessed exactly as reported by Azure, regardless of whether it exists in AKV.
